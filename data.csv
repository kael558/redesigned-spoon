Astrophysics,Laboratory Astrophysics and the State of Astronomy and Astrophysics,"  Laboratory astrophysics and complementary theoretical calculations are the foundations of astronomy and astrophysics and will remain so into the foreseeable future. The impact of laboratory astrophysics ranges from the scientific conception stage for ground-based, airborne, and space-based observatories, all the way through to the scientific return of these projects and missions. It is our understanding of the under-lying physical processes and the measurements of critical physical parameters that allows us to address fundamental questions in astronomy and astrophysics. In this regard, laboratory astrophysics is much like detector and instrument development at NASA, NSF, and DOE. These efforts are necessary for the success of astronomical research being funded by the agencies. Without concomitant efforts in all three directions (observational facilities, detector/instrument development, and laboratory astrophysics) the future progress of astronomy and astrophysics is imperiled. In addition, new developments in experimental technologies have allowed laboratory studies to take on a new role as some questions which previously could only be studied theoretically can now be addressed directly in the lab. With this in mind we, the members of the AAS Working Group on Laboratory Astrophysics, have prepared this State of the Profession Position Paper on the laboratory astrophysics infrastructure needed to ensure the advancement of astronomy and astrophysics in the next decade. "

Astrophysics,"Roles and Needs of Laboratory Astrophysics in NASA's Space and Earth
  Science Mission","  Laboratory astrophysics and complementary theoretical calculations are the foundations of astronomy and astrophysics and will remain so into the foreseeable future. The mission enabling impact of laboratory astrophysics ranges from the scientific conception stage for airborne and space-based observatories, all the way through to the scientific return of these missions. It is our understanding of the under-lying physical processes and the measurements of critical physical parameters that allows us to address fundamental questions in astronomy and astrophysics. In this regard, laboratory astrophysics is much like detector and instrument development at NASA. These efforts are necessary for the success of astronomical research being funded by NASA.

In addition, new developments in experimental technologies have allowed laboratory studies to take on a new role as some questions which previously could only be studied theoretically can now be addressed directly in the lab. With this in mind we, the members of the AAS Working Group on Laboratory Astrophysics (WGLA), have prepared this White Paper on the laboratory astrophysics infrastructure needed to maximize the scientific return from NASA's space and Earth sciences program.

Astrophysics,Laboratory Investigations into the Extreme Universe,"  Recent years have seen tremendous progress in our understanding of the extreme universe, which in turn points to even deeper questions to be further addressed. History has shown that the symbiosis between direct observations and laboratory investigations is instrumental in the progress of astrophysics. Current frontier astrophysical phenomena related to particle astrophysics and cosmology typically involve one or more of the following conditions: (1) extremely high energy events;(2) very high density, high temperature processes; (3) super strong field environments. Laboratory experiments using high intensity lasers and particle beams can calibrate astrophysical observation or detection processes, investigate the underlying dynamics of astrophysical phenomena, and probe fundamental physics in extreme limits. We give examples of possible laboratory experiments that investigate into the extreme universe. "
Astrophysics,Scientific Productivity with X-ray All-Sky Monitors,"  We outline scientific objectives for monitoring X-ray sources and transients with wide-angle, coded mask cameras. It is now possible to instantaneously view half of the sky over long time intervals, gaining access to events of extraordinary interest. Solid state detectors can raise the quality of data products for bright sources to levels associated with pointed instruments. There are diverse ways to advance high energy astrophysics and quantitative applications for general relativity. "
Astrophysics,Open issues in neutrino astrophysics,"  Neutrinos of astrophysical origin are messengers produced in stars, in explosive phenomena like core-collapse supernovae, in the accretion disks around black holes, or in the Earth's atmosphere. Their fluxes and spectra encode information on the environments that produce them. Such fluxes are modified in characteristic ways when neutrinos traverse a medium. Here our current understanding of neutrino flavour conversion in media is summarized. The importance of this domain for astrophysical observations is emphasized. Examples are given of the fundamental properties that astrophysical neutrinos have uncovered, or might reveal in the future. "

Mathematics,Categories without structures,"  The popular view according to which Category theory provides a support for Mathematical Structuralism is erroneous. Category-theoretic foundations of mathematics require a different philosophy of mathematics. While structural mathematics studies invariant forms (Awodey) categorical mathematics studies covariant transformations which, generally, don t have any invariants. In this paper I develop a non-structuralist interpretation of categorical mathematics and show its consequences for history of mathematics and mathematics education. "

Mathematics,"Mathematics Turned Inside Out: The Intensive Faculty Versus the
  Extensive Faculty","  Research universities in the United States have larger mathematics faculties outside their mathematics departments than inside. Members of this ""extensive"" faculty conduct most mathematics research, their interests are the most heavily published areas of mathematics, and they teach this mathematics in upper division courses independent of mathematics departments. The existence of this de facto faculty challenges the pertinence of institutional and national policies for higher education in mathematics, and of philosophical and sociological studies of mathematics that are limited to mathematics departments alone. "
Mathematics,"Situating ""Ethics in Mathematics"" as a Philosophy of Mathematics Ethics
  Education","  In this paper, we situate the educational movement of ""Ethics in Mathematics,"" as outlined by the Cambridge University Ethics in Mathematics Project, in the wider area of mathematics ethics education. By focusing on the core message coming out of Ethics in Mathematics, its target group, and educational philosophy, we set it into relation with ""Mathematics for Social Justice"" and Paul Ernest's recent work on ethics of mathematics. We conclude that, although both Ethics in Mathematics and Mathematics for Social Justice appear antagonistic at first glance, they can be understood as complementary rather than competing educational strategies. "

Economics,"The Link Between Standardization and Economic Growth: A Bibliometric
  Analysis","  We analyze the link between standardization and economic growth by systematically reviewing leading economics journals, leading economic growth researchers' articles, and economic growth-related books. We make the following observations: 1) No article has analyzed the link between standardization and economic growth in top5 economics journals between 1996 and 2018. 2) A representative sample of the leading researchers of economic growth has allocated little attention to the link between standardization and economic growth. 3) Typically, economic growth textbooks do not contain ""standards"" or ""standardization"" in their word indexes. These findings suggest that the economic growth theory has neglected the role of standardization. "
Economics,"Why Economic Theories and Policies Fail? Unnoticed Variables and
  Overlooked Economics","  Accuracy of economic theories and efficiency of economic policy strictly depend on the choice of the economic variables and processes mostly liable for description of economic reality. That states the general problem of assessment of any possible economic variables and processes chargeable for economic evolution. We show that economic variables and processes described by current economic theories constitute only a negligible fraction of factors responsible for economic dynamics. We consider numerous unnoted economic variables and overlooked economic processes those determine the states and predictions of the real economics. We regard collective economic variables, collective transactions and expectations, mean risks of economic variables and transactions, collective velocities and flows of economic variables, transactions and expectations as overlooked factors of economic evolution. We introduce market-based probability of the asset price and consider unnoticed influence of market stochasticity on randomness of macroeconomic variables. We introduce economic domain composed by continuous numeric risk grades and outline that the bounds of the economic domain result in unnoticed inherent cyclical motion of collective variables, transactions and expectations those are responsible for observed business cycles. Our treatment of unnoticed and overlooked factors of theoretical economics and policy decisions preserves a wide field of studies for many decades for academic researchers, economic authorities and high-level politicians. "
Economics,Business Cycles as Collective Risk Fluctuations,"  We suggest use continuous numerical risk grades [0,1] of R for a single risk or the unit cube in Rn for n risks as the economic domain. We consider risk ratings of economic agents as their coordinates in the economic domain. Economic activity of agents, economic or other factors change agents risk ratings and that cause motion of agents in the economic domain. Aggregations of variables and transactions of individual agents in small volume of economic domain establish the continuous economic media approximation that describes collective variables, transactions and their flows in the economic domain as functions of risk coordinates. Any economic variable A(t,x) defines mean risk XA(t) as risk weighted by economic variable A(t,x). Collective flows of economic variables in bounded economic domain fluctuate from secure to risky area and back. These fluctuations of flows cause time oscillations of macroeconomic variables A(t) and their mean risks XA(t) in economic domain and are the origin of any business and credit cycles. We derive equations that describe evolution of collective variables, transactions and their flows in the economic domain. As illustration we present simple self-consistent equations of supply-demand cycles that describe fluctuations of supply, demand and their mean risks. "
Economics,"Econophysics of Macroeconomics: ""Action-at-a-Distance"" and Waves","  We present macroeconomic model that describes evolution of macroeconomic variables and macroeconomic waves on economic space. Risk ratings of economic agents play role of their coordinates on economic space. Aggregation of economic variables like Assets and Investment, Credits and Loans of economic agents at point x define corresponding macroeconomic variables as functions of time t and coordinates x on economic space. Evolution of macroeconomic variables is determined by economic and financial transactions between economic agents. Such transactions can occur between economic agents with any coordinates x and y and that reflect non-local ""action-at-a-distance"" character of internal macroeconomic interactions. For instance, Buy-Sell transactions between points x and y on economic space define dynamics of Assets at point x and Investment at point y. Aggregates of transactions between economic agents at point x and y on economic space define economic fields as functions of two coordinates. To describe dynamics of economic fields on economic space we derive hydrodynamic-like equations. For simple models of interactions between economic fields we derive hydrodynamic-like equations in a closed form and obtain wave equations for their perturbations. Economic field waves propagate on economic space and their amplitudes can grow up as exponent in time and may disturb economic stability. Diversities of macroeconomic and financial waves on economic space in simple models uncover importance of wave processes for macroeconomic modeling and forecasting. "
Economics,Econophysics Macroeconomic Model,"  This paper presents macroeconomic model that is based on parallels between macroeconomic multi-agent systems and multi-particle systems. We use risk ratings of economic agents as their coordinates on economic space. Aggregates of economic or financial variables like Investment, Assets, Demand, Credits and etc. of economic agents near point x define corresponding macroeconomic variables as functions of time t and coordinates x on economic space. Parallels between multi-agent and multi-particle systems on economic space allow describe transition from economic kinetic-like to economic hydrodynamic-like approximation and derive macroeconomic hydrodynamic-like equations on economic space. Economic or financial transactions between economic agents determine evolution of macroeconomic variables This paper describes local macroeconomic approximation that takes into account transactions between economic agents with coordinates near same point x on economic space only and describes interaction between macroeconomic variables by linear differential operators. For simple model of interaction between macroeconomic variables as Demand on Investment and Interest Rate we derive hydrodynamic-like equations in a closed form. For perturbations of these macroeconomic variables we derive macroeconomic wave equations. Macroeconomic waves on economic space can propagate with exponential growth of amplitude and cause irregular time fluctuations of macroeconomic variables or induce economic crises. "
Economics,"Economic prospects of the Russian-Chinese partnership in the logistics

The opinions of not only Russian, but also Chinese experts on these projects are indicated, which provides the expansion of the vision of the concept of the New Silk Road in both countries. "
Economics,"Measurement of Economic Growth, Development and Under Development: New
  Model and Application","  This paper presents a simple model to measure the relative economic growth of economic systems. The model considers S-Shaped patterns of economic growth that, represented with a linear model, measure how an economic system grows in comparison with another one. In particular, this model introduces an approach which indicates if the economic system has a process of economic growth, development or under development. The application of the model is provided for regions and macro regions of the Italian economic system. "
Economics,"Econophysics of Business Cycles: Aggregate Economic Fluctuations, Mean
  Risks and Mean Square Risks","  This paper presents hydrodynamic-like model of business cycles aggregate fluctuations of economic and financial variables. We model macroeconomics as ensemble of economic agents on economic space and agent's risk ratings play role of their coordinates. Sum of economic variables of agents with coordinate x define macroeconomic variables as functions of time and coordinates x. We describe evolution and interactions between macro variables on economic space by hydrodynamic-like equations. Integral of macro variables over economic space defines aggregate economic or financial variables as functions of time t only. Hydrodynamic-like equations define fluctuations of aggregate variables. Motion of agents from low risk to high risk area and back define the origin for repeated fluctuations of aggregate variables. Economic or financial variables on economic space may define statistical moments like mean risk, mean square risk and higher. Fluctuations of statistical moments describe phases of financial and economic cycles. As example we present a simple model relations between Assets and Revenue-on-Assets and derive hydrodynamic-like equations that describe evolution and interaction between these variables. Hydrodynamic-like equations permit derive systems of ordinary differential equations that describe fluctuations of aggregate Assets, Assets mean risks and Assets mean square risks. Our approach allows describe business cycle aggregate fluctuations induced by interactions between any number of economic or financial variables. "
Economics,Narratives in economics,"  There is growing awareness within the economics profession of the important role narratives play in the economy. Even though empirical approaches that try to quantify economic narratives are getting increasingly popular, there is no theory or even a universally accepted definition of economic narratives underlying this research. First, we review and categorize the economic literature concerned with narratives and work out the different paradigms that are at play. Only a subset of the literature considers narratives to be active drivers of economic activity. In order to solidify the foundation of narrative economics, we propose a definition of collective economic narratives, isolating five important characteristics. We argue that, for a narrative to be economically relevant, it must be a sense-making story that emerges in a social context and suggests action to a social group. We also systematize how a collective economic narrative differs from a topic and from other kinds of narratives that are likely to have less impact on the economy. With regard to the popular use of topic modeling as an empirical strategy, we suggest that the complementary use of other canonical methods from the natural language processing toolkit and the development of new methods is inevitable to go beyond identifying topics and be able to move towards true empirical narrative economics. "
Economics,"Impact of Public and Private Investments on Economic Growth of
  Developing Countries","  This paper aims to study the impact of public and private investments on the economic growth of developing countries. The study uses the panel data of 39 developing countries covering the periods 1990-2019. The study was based on the neoclassical growth models or exogenous growth models state in which land, labor, capital accumulation, etc., and technology proved substantial for economic growth. The paper finds that public investment has a strong positive impact on economic growth than private investment. Gross capital formation, labor growth, and government final consumption expenditure were found significant in explaining the economic growth. Overall, both public and private investments are substantial for the economic growth and development of developing countries. "

Economics,"Impact of digital economic activity on regional economic growth: A Case
  study from northern Minas Gerais between 2009 To 2018","  At present, the economic measurement of the national statistical offices has not defined or captured the benefits of the digital economy activity due to the low quality or inexistence of methodologies. Currently, there is a relevant debate on the capacity of the digital economy activity to generate productivity, economic growth, and well-being through innovation and knowledge. For this reason, this research identified and studied specialized knowledge, human settlement, and digital economic activity as the factors that influence regional economic growth. As a result, the impact generated by a new business operating models based on information technology was measured. Furthermore, this research used an empirical measurement model that made it possible to identify certain phenomena such as regional poles of regional economic development (PRDE) that surround economically flourishing regions. In addition, it showed that municipalities with high degrees of economic growth were impacted by digital economic activity and specialized knowledge. This finding is consistent with economic growth theories that point to technological evolution as the main factor of modern economic growth. Consequently, this study contributed beneficial results to the local government to develop strategies framed in solving industrial cooperation of economically flourishing regions with their neighbors, facing the problem of agglomeration of resources and capital reflected in human settlement promote an imbalance in economic growth and social development. "
Economics,The Economic Costs of Containing a Pandemic,"  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused one of the most serious social and economic losses to countries around the world since the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918 (during World War I). It has resulted in enormous economic as well as social costs, such as increased deaths from the spread of infection in a region. This is because public regulations imposed by national and local governments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate suppression of the level of economic activity. Given this trade-off between economic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public interventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic. A major problem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts certain strata of the society. This raises an important question on how such economic losses should be shared equally across the society. At the same time, there is some antipathy towards economic compensation by means of public debt, which is likely to increase economic burden in the future. However, as Paul Samuelson once argued, much of the burden, whether due to public debt or otherwise, can only be borne by the present generation, and not by future generations. "
Economics,"Economic Reality, Economic Media and Individuals' Expectations","  This paper investigates the relationship between economic media sentiment and individuals' expetations and perceptions about economic conditions. We test if economic media sentiment Granger-causes individuals' expectations and opinions concerning economic conditions, controlling for macroeconomic variables. We develop a measure of economic media sentiment using a supervised machine learning method on a data set of Swedish economic media during the period 1993-2017. We classify the sentiment of 179,846 media items, stemming from 1,071 unique media outlets, and use the number of news items with positive and negative sentiment to construct a time series index of economic media sentiment. Our results show that this index Granger-causes individuals' perception of macroeconomic conditions. This indicates that the way the economic media selects and frames macroeconomic news matters for individuals' aggregate perception of macroeconomic reality. "
Economics,The role of complex analysis in modeling economic growth,"  Development and growth are complex and tumultuous processes. Modern economic growth theories identify some key determinants of economic growth. However, the relative importance of the determinants remains unknown, and additional variables may help clarify the directions and dimensions of the interactions. The novel stream of literature on economic complexity goes beyond aggregate measures of productive inputs, and considers instead a more granular and structural view of the productive possibilities of countries, i.e. their capabilities. Different endowments of capabilities are crucial ingredients in explaining differences in economic performances. In this paper we employ economic fitness, a measure of productive capabilities obtained through complex network techniques. Focusing on the combined roles of fitness and some more traditional drivers of growth, we build a bridge between economic growth theories and the economic complexity literature. Our findings, in agreement with other recent empirical studies, show that fitness plays a crucial role in fostering economic growth and, when it is included in the analysis, can be either complementary to traditional drivers of growth or can completely overshadow them. "
Economics,"A global economic policy uncertainty index from principal component
  analysis","  This paper constructs a global economic policy uncertainty index through the principal component analysis of the economic policy uncertainty indices for twenty primary economies around the world. We find that the PCA-based global economic policy uncertainty index is a good proxy for the economic policy uncertainty on a global scale, which is quite consistent with the GDP-weighted global economic policy uncertainty index. The PCA-based economic policy uncertainty index is found to be positively related with the volatility and correlation of the global financial market, which indicates that the stocks are more volatile and correlated when the global economic policy uncertainty is higher. The PCA-based global economic policy uncertainty index performs slightly better because the relationship between the PCA-based uncertainty and market volatility and correlation is more significant. "
Economics,Eco - No(?) - Physics - comments and reflexions -,"  How can econophysics contribute to economics? Since the relation between basic principles of physics and economics is not established, there is no reason why physical theories should be of any value for economic theory. While economic theories leave the physicists largely without orientation in this field, econo-physicists should orient themselves at concrete problems from economic practice rather than from economic academics. Thereby physicists should respect the lead of economists. This then also puts physics closer to econometrics. Then the natural strength of physics in dealing with empirical data as the fundamental basis for its research could be valuable for both, theory as well as for applications in economics. "
Economics,"Heisenberg uncertainty principle and economic analogues of basic

Statistics,Upward and downward statistical continuities,"  A real valued function $f$ defined on a subset $E$ of $\textbf{R}$, the set of real numbers, is statistically upward continuous if it preserves statistically upward half quasi-Cauchy sequences, is statistically downward continuous if it preserves statistically downward half quasi-Cauchy sequences; and a subset $E$ of $\textbf{R}$, is statistically upward compact if any sequence of points in $E$ has a statistically upward half quasi-Cauchy subsequence, is statistically downward compact if any sequence of points in $E$ has a statistically downward half quasi-Cauchy subsequence where a sequence $(x_{n})$ of points in $\textbf{R}$ is called statistically upward half quasi-Cauchy if \[ \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n}|\{k\leq n: x_{k}-x_{k+1}\geq \varepsilon\}|=0 \] is statistically downward half quasi-Cauchy if \[ \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n}|\{k\leq n: x_{k+1}-x_{k}\geq \varepsilon\}|=0 \] for every $\varepsilon>0$. We investigate statistically upward continuity, statistically downward continuity, statistically upward half compactness, statistically downward half compactness and prove interesting theorems. It turns out that uniform limit of a sequence of statistically upward continuous functions is statistically upward continuous, and uniform limit of a sequence of statistically downward continuous functions is statistically downward continuous.

Statistics,Applications of Information Theory: Statistics and Statistical Mechanics,  The method of optimizing entropy is used to (i) conduct Asymptotic Hypothesis Testing and (ii) determine the particle distribution for which Entropy is maximized. This paper focuses on two related applications of Information Theory: Statistics and Statistical Mechanics. 
Statistics,"Order statistics on the spacings between order statistics for the
  uniform distribution",  Closed-form expressions for the distributions of the order statistics on the spacings between order statistics for the uniform distribution are obtained. This generalizes a result by Fisher concerning tests of significance in the harmonic analysis of a series. 
Statistics,Statistical Inference: The Big Picture,"  Statistics has moved beyond the frequentist-Bayesian controversies of the past. Where does this leave our ability to interpret results? I suggest that a philosophy compatible with statistical practice, labeled here statistical pragmatism, serves as a foundation for inference. Statistical pragmatism is inclusive and emphasizes the assumptions that connect statistical models with observed data. I argue that introductory courses often mischaracterize the process of statistical inference and I propose an alternative ""big picture"" depiction. "
Statistics,On a geometric mean and power-law statistical distributions,  For a large class of statistical systems a geometric mean value of the observables is constrained. These observables are characterized by a power-law statistical distribution. 
Statistics,"Copula representations and order statistics for conditionally
  independent random variables",  The copula representations for conditionally independent random variables and the distribution properties of order statistics of these random variables are studied.

Statistics,"Fisher's combined probability test for high-dimensional covariance
  matrices","  Testing large covariance matrices is of fundamental importance in statistical analysis with high-dimensional data. In the past decade, three types of test statistics have been studied in the literature: quadratic form statistics, maximum form statistics, and their weighted combination. It is known that quadratic form statistics would suffer from low power against sparse alternatives and maximum form statistics would suffer from low power against dense alternatives. The weighted combination methods were introduced to enhance the power of quadratic form statistics or maximum form statistics when the weights are appropriately chosen. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to exploit the full potential of quadratic form statistics and maximum form statistics for testing high-dimensional covariance matrices. We propose a scale-invariant power enhancement test based on Fisher's method to combine the p-values of quadratic form statistics and maximum form statistics. After carefully studying the asymptotic joint distribution of quadratic form statistics and maximum form statistics, we prove that the proposed combination method retains the correct asymptotic size and boosts the power against more general alternatives. Moreover, we demonstrate the finite-sample performance in simulation studies and a real application. "

Statistics,Multivariate Statistical Analysis: A Geometric Perspective,"  A new, coordinate-free (geometric) approach to multivariate statistical analysis. General multivariate linear models and linear hypotheses are defined in geometric form. A method of constructing statistical criteria is defined for linear hypotheses. As a result, multivariate statistical analysis is developed in full analogy to classical statistical analysis. This approach is based on tensor products and modules over the ring of square matrices, supplied with an inner product. "
Statistics,Deferred statistical order convergence in Riesz spaces,"  Some types of statistical convergence such as statistical order and deferred statistical convergences have been studied and investigated in Riesz spaces, recently. In this paper, we introduce the concept of deferred statistical convergence in Riesz spaces with order convergence. Moreover, we give some relations between deferred statistical order convergence and other kinds of statistical convergences. "
Statistics,Introduction,"  The Statistics Consortium at the University of Maryland, College Park, hosted a two-day workshop on Bayesian Methods that Frequentists Should Know during April 30--May 1, 2008. The event was co-sponsored by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS), Office of Research and Methodology, National Center for Health Statistics, Survey Research Methods Section (SRMS) of the American Statistical Association, and Washington Statistical Society. The workshop was intended to bring out the positive features of Bayesian statistics in solving real-life problems, including complex problems in sample surveys and production of high-quality official statistics.
