Astrophysics,"Similarity Properties and Scaling Laws of Radiation Hydrodynamic Flows
  in Laboratory Astrophysics","The spectacular recent development of modern high-energy density laboratory facilities which concentrate more and more energy in millimetric volumes allows the astrophysical community to reproduce and to explore, in millimeter-scale targets and during very short times, astrophysical phenomena where radiation and matter are strongly coupled. The astrophysical relevance of these experiments can be checked from the similarity properties and especially scaling laws establishment, which constitutes the keystone of laboratory astrophysics. From the radiating optically thin regime to the so-called optically thick radiative pressure regime, we present in this paper, for the first time, a complete analysis of the main radiating regimes that we encountered in laboratory astrophysics with the same formalism based on the Lie-group theory. The use of the Lie group method appears as systematic which allows to construct easily and orderly the scaling laws of a given problem. This powerful tool permits to unify the recent major advances on scaling laws and to identify new similarity concepts that we discuss in this paper and which opens important applications for the present and the future laboratory astrophysics experiments. All these results enable to demonstrate theoretically that astrophysical phenomena in such radiating regimes can be explored experimentally thanks to powerful facilities. Consequently the results presented here are a fundamental tool for the high-energy density laboratory astrophysics community in order to quantify the astrophysics relevance and justify laser experiments. Moreover, relying on the Lie-group theory, this paper constitutes the starting point of any analysis of the self-similar dynamics of radiating fluids.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4884v1

We have reviewed MESSENGER flight telemetry and X-ray Spectrometer observations from the first two encounters, and correlate several prominent features in the data with the presence of astrophysical X-ray sources in the instrument field of view. We find that two X-ray peaks attributed in earlier work to the detection of suprathermal electrons from the Mercury magnetosphere, are likely to contain a significant number of events that are of astrophysical origin. The intensities of these two peaks cannot be explained entirely on the basis of astrophysical sources, and we support the previous suprathermal explanation but suggest that the electron fluxes derived in those studies be revised to correct for a significant astrophysical signal.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4884v1

Other than cosmology, astrophysics particularly deals with understanding phenomena and processes operating at ""intermediate"" cosmic scales, which has rarely aroused philosophical interest so far. Being confronted with the attribution of antirealism by Ian Hacking because of its observational nature, astrophysics is equipped with a characteristic methodology that can cope with the missing possibility of direct interaction with most objects of research. In its attempt to understand the causal history of singular phenomena it resembles the historical sciences, while the search for general causal relations with respect to classes of processes or objects can rely on the ""cosmic laboratory"": the multitude of different phenomena and environments, naturally provided by the universe. Furthermore, the epistemology of astrophysics is strongly based on the use of models and simulations and a complex treatment of large amounts of data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4884v1

Astrophysics,Statistical properties of astrophysical gravitational-wave backgrounds,"We investigate how a stochastic gravitational wave background, produced from a discrete set of astrophysical sources, differs from an idealised model consisting of an isotropic, unpolarised, and Gaussian background. We focus, in particular, on the different signatures produced from these two cases, as observed in a cross-correlation search. We show that averaged over many realisations of an astrophysical background, the cross-correlation measurement of an astrophysical background is identical to that of an idealised background. However, any one realisation of an astrophysical background can produce a different signature. Using a model consisting of an ensemble of binary neutron star coalescences, we quantify the typical difference between the signal from individual realisations of the astrophysical background and the idealised case. For advanced detectors, we find that, using a cross-correlation analysis, astrophysical backgrounds from many discrete sources are probably indistinguishable from an idealised background.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4884v1
Astrophysics,"Robust, open-source removal of systematics in Kepler data","We present ARC2 (Astrophysically Robust Correction 2), an open-source Python-based systematics-correction pipeline to correct for the Kepler prime mission long cadence light curves. The ARC2 pipeline identifies and corrects any isolated discontinuities in the light curves, then removes trends common to many light curves. These trends are modelled using the publicly available co-trending basis vectors, within an (approximate) Bayesian framework with `shrinkage' priors to minimise the risk of over-fitting and the injection of any additional noise into the corrected light curves, while keeping any astrophysical signals intact. We show that the ARC2 pipeline's performance matches that of the standard Kepler PDC-MAP data products using standard noise metrics, and demonstrate its ability to preserve astrophysical signals using injection tests with simulated stellar rotation and planetary transit signals. Although it is not identical, the ARC2 pipeline can thus be used as an open source alternative to PDC-MAP, whenever the ability to model the impact of the systematics removal process on other kinds of signal is important.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4884v1
Astrophysics,A Catalog of Astrophysical Neutrino Candidates for IceCube,"Multi-messenger astrophysics will enable the discovery of new astrophysical neutrino sources and provide information about the mechanisms that drive these objects. We present a curated online catalog of astrophysical neutrino candidates. Whenever single high energy neutrino events, that are publicly available, get published multiple times from various analyses, the catalog records all these changes and highlights the best information. All studies by IceCube that produce astrophysical candidates will be included in our catalog. All information produced by these searches such as time, type, direction, neutrino energy and signalness will be contained in the catalog. The multi-messenger astrophysical community will be able to select neutrinos with certain characteristics, e.g. within a declination range, visualize data for the selected neutrinos, and finally download data in their preferred form to conduct further studies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4884v1
Astrophysics,"Properties of the stochastic astrophysical gravitational wave
  background: astrophysical sources dependencies","This article explores the properties (amplitude and shape) of the angular power spectrum of the anisotropies of the astrophysical gravitational wave background (AGWB) focusing on the signatures of the astrophysical models describing sub-galactic physics. It demonstrates that while some parameters have negligible impact others, and in particular the stellar evolution models, the metallicity and the merger time delay distribution can result in relative differences of order 40% in the angular power spectrum of anisotropies in both the LIGO/Virgo and LISA frequency bands. It is also shown that the monopole and the anisotropic components of the AGWB are complementary and sensitive to different astrophysical parameters. It follows that AGWB anisotropies are a new observable with the potential to provide new astrophysical information that can not be accessed otherwise.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4884v1
Astrophysics,"Nuclear physics uncertainties in neutrino-driven, neutron-rich supernova
  ejecta","Neutrino-driven ejecta in core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) offer an interesting astrophysical scenario where lighter heavy elements between Sr and Ag can be synthesized. Previous studies emphasized the important role that ($\alpha,n$) reactions play in the production of these elements, particularly in neutron-rich and alpha-rich environments. In this paper, we have investigated the sensitivity of elemental abundances to specific ($\alpha,n$) reaction-rate uncertainties under different astrophysical conditions. Following a Monte Carlo nucleosynthesis study with over 36 representative astrophysical wind conditions, we have identified the most important reactions based on their impact on the final elemental abundances. Experimental studies of these reactions will reduce the nucleosynthesis uncertainties and make it possible to use observations to understand the origin of lighter heavy elements and the astrophysical conditions where they are formed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4884v1
Astrophysics,"A Cross-Correlation Study of High-energy Neutrinos and Tracers of
  Large-Scale Structure","The origin of the bulk of the astrophysical neutrinos detected by the IceCube Observatory remains a mystery. Previous source-finding analyses compare the directions of IceCube events and individual sources in astrophysical catalogs. The source association method is technically challenging when the number of source candidates is much larger than the number of the observed astrophysical neutrinos. We show that in this large source number regime, a cross-correlation analysis of neutrino data and source catalog can instead be used to constrain potential source populations for the high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, and provide spatial evidence for the existence of astrophysical neutrinos. We present an analysis of the cross-correlation of the IceCube 2010-2012 point-source data and a WISE-2MASS galaxy sample. While we find no significant detection of cross-correlation with the publicly available neutrino dataset, we show that, when applied to the full IceCube data, which has a longer observation time and higher astrophysical neutrino purity, our method has sufficient statistical power to detect a cross-correlation signal if the neutrino sources trace the Large Scale Structure of the Universe.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4884v1
Astrophysics,Well-being in French Astrophysics,"It has become clear that early career astrophysics researchers (doctoral researchers, post-docs, etc) have a very diverse appreciation of their career, with some declaring it the best job that you can have and others suffering from overwork, harrassment and stress from the precarity of their job, and associated difficulties. In order to establish how astrophysics researchers, primarily in France, experience their career, we sent out a survey to understand the impact that their job has on their well-being. 276 people responded to the survey. Whilst around half of the respondents expressed pleasure derived from their career, it is clear that many (early career) researchers are suffering due to overwork, with more than a quarter saying that they work in excess of 50 hours per week and 2\% in excess of 90 h per week. Almost 30\% professed to having suffered harrassment or discrimination in the course of their work. Further, whilst only 20\% had suffered mental health issues before starting their career in astrophysics, $\sim$45\% said that they suffered with mental health problems since starting in astrophysics. Here we provide results from the survey as well as possible avenues to explore and a list of recommendations to improve (early) careers in astrophysics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4884v1

Astrophysics,Astrophysical Observations: Lensing and Eclipsing Einstein's Theories,"Albert Einstein postulated the equivalence of energy and mass, developed the theory of special relativity, explained the photoelectric effect, and described Brownian motion in five papers, all published in 1905, 100 years ago. With these papers, Einstein provided the framework for understanding modern astrophysical phenomena. Conversely, astrophysical observations provide one of the most effective means for testing Einstein's theories. Here, I review astrophysical advances precipitated by Einstein's insights, including gravitational redshifts, gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, the Lense-Thirring effect, and modern cosmology. A complete understanding of cosmology, from the earliest moments to the ultimate fate of the universe, will require developments in physics beyond Einstein, to a unified theory of gravity and quantum physics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4884v1

Astrophysics,Importance of an Astrophysical Perspective for Textbook Relativity,The importance of a teaching a clear definition of the ``observer'' in special relativity is highlighted using a simple astrophysical example from the exciting current research area of ``Gamma-Ray Burst'' astrophysics. The example shows that a source moving relativistically toward a single observer at rest exhibits a time ``contraction'' rather than a ``dilation'' because the light travel time between the source and observer decreases with time. Astrophysical applications of special relativity complement idealized examples with real applications and very effectively exemplify the role of a finite light travel time.,http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4884v1

We investigate the possible origin of intense magnetic fields $\sim 10^{15}-10^{16}$ by NMGEC near rotating neutron stars and black holes, connected with magnetars, quasars, and gamma-ray bursts. Whereas these intense magnetic fields are difficult to explain astrophysically, we find that they are easily explained by NMGEC.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4884v1

Our Project began with the development of a program that can be used to generate invariant-relation and property-relation conjectures in many areas of mathematics. This program can produce conjectures which are not implied by existing (published) theorems. Here we propose a new approach to push forward existing mathematical research goals---using automated mathematical discovery software. We suggest how to initiate and harness large-scale collaborative mathematics. We envision mathematical research labs similar to what exist in other sciences, new avenues for funding, new opportunities for training students, and a more efficient and effective use of published mathematical research.   And our experiment in graph theory can be imitated in many other areas of mathematical research.

Mathematics,"The Physicalization of Metamathematics and Its Implications for the
  Foundations of Mathematics","Both metamathematics and physics are posited to emerge from samplings by observers of the unique ruliad structure that corresponds to the entangled limit of all possible computations. The possibility of higher-level mathematics accessible to humans is posited to be the analog for mathematical observers of the perception of physical space for physical observers. A physicalized analysis is given of the bulk limit of traditional axiomatic approaches to the foundations of mathematics, together with explicit empirical metamathematics of some examples of formalized mathematics. General physicalized laws of mathematics are discussed, associated with concepts such as metamathematical motion, inevitable dualities, proof topology and metamathematical singularities. It is argued that mathematics as currently practiced can be viewed as derived from the ruliad in a direct Platonic fashion analogous to our experience of the physical world, and that axiomatic formulation, while often convenient, does not capture the ultimate character of mathematics. Among the implications of this view is that only certain collections of axioms may be consistent with inevitable features of human mathematical observers. A discussion is included of historical and philosophical connections, as well as of foundational implications for the future of mathematics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0208009v1

Economics,"Why Economic Theories and Policies Fail? Unnoticed Variables and
  Overlooked Economics","Accuracy of economic theories and efficiency of economic policy strictly depend on the choice of the economic variables and processes mostly liable for description of economic reality. That states the general problem of assessment of any possible economic variables and processes chargeable for economic evolution. We show that economic variables and processes described by current economic theories constitute only a negligible fraction of factors responsible for economic dynamics. We consider numerous unnoted economic variables and overlooked economic processes those determine the states and predictions of the real economics. We regard collective economic variables, collective transactions and expectations, mean risks of economic variables and transactions, collective velocities and flows of economic variables, transactions and expectations as overlooked factors of economic evolution. We introduce market-based probability of the asset price and consider unnoticed influence of market stochasticity on randomness of macroeconomic variables. We introduce economic domain composed by continuous numeric risk grades and outline that the bounds of the economic domain result in unnoticed inherent cyclical motion of collective variables, transactions and expectations those are responsible for observed business cycles. Our treatment of unnoticed and overlooked factors of theoretical economics and policy decisions preserves a wide field of studies for many decades for academic researchers, economic authorities and high-level politicians.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,Business Cycles as Collective Risk Fluctuations,"We suggest use continuous numerical risk grades [0,1] of R for a single risk or the unit cube in Rn for n risks as the economic domain. We consider risk ratings of economic agents as their coordinates in the economic domain. Economic activity of agents, economic or other factors change agents risk ratings and that cause motion of agents in the economic domain. Aggregations of variables and transactions of individual agents in small volume of economic domain establish the continuous economic media approximation that describes collective variables, transactions and their flows in the economic domain as functions of risk coordinates. Any economic variable A(t,x) defines mean risk XA(t) as risk weighted by economic variable A(t,x). Collective flows of economic variables in bounded economic domain fluctuate from secure to risky area and back. These fluctuations of flows cause time oscillations of macroeconomic variables A(t) and their mean risks XA(t) in economic domain and are the origin of any business and credit cycles. We derive equations that describe evolution of collective variables, transactions and their flows in the economic domain. As illustration we present simple self-consistent equations of supply-demand cycles that describe fluctuations of supply, demand and their mean risks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,"Econophysics of Macroeconomics: ""Action-at-a-Distance"" and Waves","We present macroeconomic model that describes evolution of macroeconomic variables and macroeconomic waves on economic space. Risk ratings of economic agents play role of their coordinates on economic space. Aggregation of economic variables like Assets and Investment, Credits and Loans of economic agents at point x define corresponding macroeconomic variables as functions of time t and coordinates x on economic space. Evolution of macroeconomic variables is determined by economic and financial transactions between economic agents. Such transactions can occur between economic agents with any coordinates x and y and that reflect non-local ""action-at-a-distance"" character of internal macroeconomic interactions. For instance, Buy-Sell transactions between points x and y on economic space define dynamics of Assets at point x and Investment at point y. Aggregates of transactions between economic agents at point x and y on economic space define economic fields as functions of two coordinates. To describe dynamics of economic fields on economic space we derive hydrodynamic-like equations. For simple models of interactions between economic fields we derive hydrodynamic-like equations in a closed form and obtain wave equations for their perturbations. Economic field waves propagate on economic space and their amplitudes can grow up as exponent in time and may disturb economic stability. Diversities of macroeconomic and financial waves on economic space in simple models uncover importance of wave processes for macroeconomic modeling and forecasting.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

Parallels between multi-agent and multi-particle systems on economic space allow describe transition from economic kinetic-like to economic hydrodynamic-like approximation and derive macroeconomic hydrodynamic-like equations on economic space. Economic or financial transactions between economic agents determine evolution of macroeconomic variables This paper describes local macroeconomic approximation that takes into account transactions between economic agents with coordinates near same point x on economic space only and describes interaction between macroeconomic variables by linear differential operators. For simple model of interaction between macroeconomic variables as Demand on Investment and Interest Rate we derive hydrodynamic-like equations in a closed form.

We model macroeconomics as ensemble of economic agents on economic space and agent's risk ratings play role of their coordinates. Sum of economic variables of agents with coordinate x define macroeconomic variables as functions of time and coordinates x. We describe evolution and interactions between macro variables on economic space by hydrodynamic-like equations. Integral of macro variables over economic space defines aggregate economic or financial variables as functions of time t only. Hydrodynamic-like equations define fluctuations of aggregate variables. Motion of agents from low risk to high risk area and back define the origin for repeated fluctuations of aggregate variables. Economic or financial variables on economic space may define statistical moments like mean risk, mean square risk and higher. Fluctuations of statistical moments describe phases of financial and economic cycles. As example we present a simple model relations between Assets and Revenue-on-Assets and derive hydrodynamic-like equations that describe evolution and interaction between these variables. Hydrodynamic-like equations permit derive systems of ordinary differential equations that describe fluctuations of aggregate Assets, Assets mean risks and Assets mean square risks. Our approach allows describe business cycle aggregate fluctuations induced by interactions between any number of economic or financial variables.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,Narratives in economics,"There is growing awareness within the economics profession of the important role narratives play in the economy. Even though empirical approaches that try to quantify economic narratives are getting increasingly popular, there is no theory or even a universally accepted definition of economic narratives underlying this research. First, we review and categorize the economic literature concerned with narratives and work out the different paradigms that are at play. Only a subset of the literature considers narratives to be active drivers of economic activity. In order to solidify the foundation of narrative economics, we propose a definition of collective economic narratives, isolating five important characteristics. We argue that, for a narrative to be economically relevant, it must be a sense-making story that emerges in a social context and suggests action to a social group. We also systematize how a collective economic narrative differs from a topic and from other kinds of narratives that are likely to have less impact on the economy. With regard to the popular use of topic modeling as an empirical strategy, we suggest that the complementary use of other canonical methods from the natural language processing toolkit and the development of new methods is inevitable to go beyond identifying topics and be able to move towards true empirical narrative economics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,"Impact of Public and Private Investments on Economic Growth of
  Developing Countries","This paper aims to study the impact of public and private investments on the economic growth of developing countries. The study uses the panel data of 39 developing countries covering the periods 1990-2019. The study was based on the neoclassical growth models or exogenous growth models state in which land, labor, capital accumulation, etc., and technology proved substantial for economic growth. The paper finds that public investment has a strong positive impact on economic growth than private investment. Gross capital formation, labor growth, and government final consumption expenditure were found significant in explaining the economic growth. Overall, both public and private investments are substantial for the economic growth and development of developing countries.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

Economics,"Impact of digital economic activity on regional economic growth: A Case
  study from northern Minas Gerais between 2009 To 2018","At present, the economic measurement of the national statistical offices has not defined or captured the benefits of the digital economy activity due to the low quality or inexistence of methodologies. Currently, there is a relevant debate on the capacity of the digital economy activity to generate productivity, economic growth, and well-being through innovation and knowledge. For this reason, this research identified and studied specialized knowledge, human settlement, and digital economic activity as the factors that influence regional economic growth. As a result, the impact generated by a new business operating models based on information technology was measured. Furthermore, this research used an empirical measurement model that made it possible to identify certain phenomena such as regional poles of regional economic development (PRDE) that surround economically flourishing regions. In addition, it showed that municipalities with high degrees of economic growth were impacted by digital economic activity and specialized knowledge. This finding is consistent with economic growth theories that point to technological evolution as the main factor of modern economic growth. Consequently, this study contributed beneficial results to the local government to develop strategies framed in solving industrial cooperation of economically flourishing regions with their neighbors, facing the problem of agglomeration of resources and capital reflected in human settlement promote an imbalance in economic growth and social development.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,The Economic Costs of Containing a Pandemic,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused one of the most serious social and economic losses to countries around the world since the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918 (during World War I). It has resulted in enormous economic as well as social costs, such as increased deaths from the spread of infection in a region. This is because public regulations imposed by national and local governments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate suppression of the level of economic activity. Given this trade-off between economic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public interventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic. A major problem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts certain strata of the society. This raises an important question on how such economic losses should be shared equally across the society. At the same time, there is some antipathy towards economic compensation by means of public debt, which is likely to increase economic burden in the future. However, as Paul Samuelson once argued, much of the burden, whether due to public debt or otherwise, can only be borne by the present generation, and not by future generations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,"Economic Reality, Economic Media and Individuals' Expectations","This paper investigates the relationship between economic media sentiment and individuals' expetations and perceptions about economic conditions. We test if economic media sentiment Granger-causes individuals' expectations and opinions concerning economic conditions, controlling for macroeconomic variables. We develop a measure of economic media sentiment using a supervised machine learning method on a data set of Swedish economic media during the period 1993-2017. We classify the sentiment of 179,846 media items, stemming from 1,071 unique media outlets, and use the number of news items with positive and negative sentiment to construct a time series index of economic media sentiment. Our results show that this index Granger-causes individuals' perception of macroeconomic conditions. This indicates that the way the economic media selects and frames macroeconomic news matters for individuals' aggregate perception of macroeconomic reality.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,The role of complex analysis in modeling economic growth,"Development and growth are complex and tumultuous processes. Modern economic growth theories identify some key determinants of economic growth. However, the relative importance of the determinants remains unknown, and additional variables may help clarify the directions and dimensions of the interactions. The novel stream of literature on economic complexity goes beyond aggregate measures of productive inputs, and considers instead a more granular and structural view of the productive possibilities of countries, i.e. their capabilities. Different endowments of capabilities are crucial ingredients in explaining differences in economic performances. In this paper we employ economic fitness, a measure of productive capabilities obtained through complex network techniques. Focusing on the combined roles of fitness and some more traditional drivers of growth, we build a bridge between economic growth theories and the economic complexity literature. Our findings, in agreement with other recent empirical studies, show that fitness plays a crucial role in fostering economic growth and, when it is included in the analysis, can be either complementary to traditional drivers of growth or can completely overshadow them.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,"A global economic policy uncertainty index from principal component
  analysis","This paper constructs a global economic policy uncertainty index through the principal component analysis of the economic policy uncertainty indices for twenty primary economies around the world. We find that the PCA-based global economic policy uncertainty index is a good proxy for the economic policy uncertainty on a global scale, which is quite consistent with the GDP-weighted global economic policy uncertainty index. The PCA-based economic policy uncertainty index is found to be positively related with the volatility and correlation of the global financial market, which indicates that the stocks are more volatile and correlated when the global economic policy uncertainty is higher. The PCA-based global economic policy uncertainty index performs slightly better because the relationship between the PCA-based uncertainty and market volatility and correlation is more significant.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

Since the relation between basic principles of physics and economics is not established, there is no reason why physical theories should be of any value for economic theory. While economic theories leave the physicists largely without orientation in this field, econo-physicists should orient themselves at concrete problems from economic practice rather than from economic academics. Thereby physicists should respect the lead of economists. This then also puts physics closer to econometrics. Then the natural strength of physics in dealing with empirical data as the fundamental basis for its research could be valuable for both, theory as well as for applications in economics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

Economics,Potterian Economics,"Recent studies in psychology and neuroscience offer systematic evidence that fictional works exert a surprisingly strong influence on readers and have the power to shape their opinions and worldviews. Building on these findings, we study what we term Potterian economics, the economic ideas, insights, and structure, found in Harry Potter books, to assess how the books might affect economic literacy. A conservative estimate suggests that more than 7.3 percent of the world population has read the Harry Potter books, and millions more have seen their movie adaptations. These extraordinary figures underscore the importance of the messages the books convey. We explore the Potterian economic model and compare it to professional economic models to assess the consistency of the Potterian economic principles with the existing economic models. We find that some of the principles of Potterian economics are consistent with economists models. Many other principles, however, are distorted and contain numerous inaccuracies, contradicting professional economists views and insights. We conclude that Potterian economics can teach us about the formation and dissemination of folk economics, the intuitive notions of naive individuals who see market transactions as a zero-sum game, who care about distribution but fail to understand incentives and efficiency, and who think of prices as allocating wealth but not resources or their efficient use.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

  computational economic analysis","Our computational economic analysis investigates the relationship between inequality, mobility and the financial accumulation process. Extending the baseline model by Levy et al., we characterise the economic process through stylised return structures generating alternative evolutions of income and wealth through time. First, we explore the limited heuristic contribution of one and two factors models comprising one single stock (capital wealth) and one single flow factor (labour) as pure drivers of income and wealth generation and allocation over time. Second, we introduce heuristic modes of taxation in line with the baseline approach. Our computational economic analysis corroborates that the financial accumulation process featuring compound returns plays a significant role as source of inequality, while institutional arrangements including taxation play a significant role in framing and shaping the aggregate economic process that evolves over socioeconomic space and time.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,"Entrepreneurship, Institutions, and Economic Growth: Does the Level of
  Development Matter?","Entrepreneurship is often touted for its ability to generate economic growth. Through the creative-destructive process, entrepreneurs are often able to innovate and outperform incumbent organizations, all of which is supposed to lead to higher employment and economic growth. Although some empirical evidence supports this logic, it has also been the subject of recent criticisms. Specifically, entrepreneurship does not lead to growth in developing countries; it only does in more developed countries with higher income levels. Using Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data for a panel of 83 countries from 2002 to 2014, we examine the contribution of entrepreneurship towards economic growth. Our evidence validates earlier studies findings but also exposes previously undiscovered findings. That is, we find that entrepreneurship encourages economic growth but not in developing countries. In addition, our evidence finds that the institutional environment of the country, as measured by GEM Entrepreneurial Framework Conditions, only contributes to economic growth in more developed countries but not in developing countries. These findings have important policy implications. Namely, our evidence contradicts policy proposals that suggest entrepreneurship and the adoption of pro-market institutions that support it to encourage economic growth in developing countries. Our evidence suggests these policy proposals will be unlikely to generate the economic growth desired.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,Economic thermodynamics,"A thermodynamic approach to the description of economic systems and processes is developed. It is shown that there is a deep analogy between the parameters of thermodynamic and economic systems (markets); so each thermodynamic parameter can be associated with a certain economic parameter or indicator. The economic meaning of such primordially thermodynamic concepts as internal energy and temperature has been established. It is shown that many economic laws, which in economic theory are a generalization of the results of observations, or are based on the analysis of the psychology of the behavior of market actors, within the framework of economic thermodynamics can be obtained as the natural and formal results of the theory. In particular, we show that economic thermodynamics allows a natural description of such a phenomenon as inflation.

Economics,Inferring Economic Condition Uncertainty from Electricity Big Data,"Inferring the uncertainties in economic conditions are of significant importance for both decision makers as well as market players. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to construct the Economic Condition Uncertainty (ECU) index that can be used to infer the economic condition uncertainties. The ECU index is a dimensionless index ranges between zero and one, this makes it to be comparable among sectors, regions and periods. We use the daily electricity consumption data of nearly 20 thousand firms in Shanghai from 2018 to 2020 to construct the ECU indexes. Results show that all ECU indexes, no matter at sectoral level or regional level, successfully captured the negative impacts of COVID-19 on Shanghai's economic conditions. Besides, the ECU indexes also presented the heterogeneities in different districts as well as in different sectors. This reflects the facts that changes in uncertainties of economic conditions are mainly related to regional economic structures and targeted regulation policies faced by sectors. The ECU index can also be easily extended to measure uncertainties of economic conditions in different fields which has great potentials in the future.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,Econophysics Beyond General Equilibrium: the Business Cycle Model,"Current business cycle theory is an application of the general equilibrium theory. This paper presents the business cycle model without using general equilibrium framework. We treat agents risk assessments as their coordinates x on economic space and establish distribution of all economic agents by their risk coordinates. We suggest aggregation of agents and their variables by scales large to compare with risk scales of single agents and small to compare with economic domain on economic space. Such model is alike to transition from kinetic description of multi-particle system to hydrodynamic approximation. Aggregates of agents extensive variables with risk coordinate x determine macro variables as functions of x alike to hydrodynamic variables. Economic and financial transactions between agents define evolution of their variables. Aggregation of transactions between agents with risk coordinates x and y determine macro transactions as functions of x and y and define evolution of macro variables at points x and y. We describe evolution and interactions between macro transactions by hydrodynamic-like system of economic equations. We show that business cycles are described as consequence of the system of economic equations on macro transactions. As example we describe Credit transactions CL(tax,y) that provide Loans from Creditors at point x to Borrowers at point y and Loan-Repayment transactions LR(t,x,y) that describe repayments from Borrowers at point y to Creditors at point x. We use hydrodynamic-like economic equations and derive from them the system of ordinary differential equations that describe business cycle fluctuations of macro Credits C(t) and macro Loan-Repayments LR(t) of the entire economics. The nature of business cycle fluctuations is explained as oscillations of ""mean risk"" of economic variables on bounded economic domain of economic space.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,"The interconnectedness of the economic content in the speeches of the US
  Presidents","The speeches stated by influential politicians can have a decisive impact on the future of a country. In particular, the economic content of such speeches affects the economy of countries and their financial markets. For this reason, we examine a novel dataset containing the economic content of 951 speeches stated by 45 US Presidents from George Washington (April 1789) to Donald Trump (February 2017). In doing so, we use an economic glossary carried out by means of text mining techniques. The goal of our study is to examine the structure of significant interconnections within a network obtained from the economic content of presidential speeches. In such a network, nodes are represented by talks and links by values of cosine similarity, the latter computed using the occurrences of the economic terms in the speeches. The resulting network displays a peculiar structure made up of a core (i.e. a set of highly central and densely connected nodes) and a periphery (i.e. a set of non-central and sparsely connected nodes). The presence of different economic dictionaries employed by the Presidents characterize the core-periphery structure. The Presidents' talks belonging to the network's core share the usage of generic (non-technical) economic locutions like ""interest"" or ""trade"". While the use of more technical and less frequent terms characterizes the periphery (e.g. ""yield"" ). Furthermore, the speeches close in time share a common economic dictionary. These results together with the economics glossary usages during the US periods of boom and crisis provide unique insights on the economic content relationships among Presidents' speeches.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,Theoretical Economics and the Second-Order Economic Theory. What is it?,"We consider economic agents, agent's variables, agent's trades and deals with other agents and agent's expectations as ground for theoretical description of economic and financial processes. Macroeconomic and financial variables are composed by agent's variables. In turn, sums of agent's trade values or volumes determine evolution of agent's variables. In conclusion, agent's expectations govern agent's trade decisions. We consider that trinity - agent's variables, trades and expectations as simple bricks for theoretical description of economics. We note models that describe variables determined by sums of market trades during certain time interval {\Delta} as the first-order economic theories. Most current economic models belong to the first-order economic theories. However, we show that these models are insufficient for adequate economic description. Trade decisions substantially depend on market price forecasting. We show that reasonable predictions of market price volatility equal descriptions of sums of squares of trade values and volumes during {\Delta}. We call modeling variables composed by sums of squares of market trades as the second-order economic theories. If forecast of price probability uses 3-d price statistical moment and price skewness then it equals description of sums of 3-d power of market trades - the third-order economic theory. Exact prediction of market price probability equals description of sums of n-th power of market trades for all n. That limits accuracy of price probability forecasting and confines forecast validity of economic theories.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,How to predict and avert economic crisis,"Our study shows that many firms would accumulate at zero output level (namely, Bankruptcy status) if a perfectly competitive market reaches full employment (namely, those people who should obtain employment have obtained employment). As a result, appearance of economic crisis is determined by two points; that is, (a). Stock market approaches perfect competition; (b). Society reaches full employment. The empirical research of these two points would lead to early warning of economic crisis. Moreover, it is a surprise that the state of economic crisis would be a feasible equilibrium within the framework of the Arrow-Debreu model. That means that we can not understand the origin of economic crisis within the framework of modern economics, for example, the general equilibrium theory.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

  change mitigation policy","Conventional economic analysis of stringent climate change mitigation policy generally concludes various levels of economic slowdown as a result of substantial spending on low carbon technology. Equilibrium economics however could not explain or predict the current economic crisis, which is of financial nature. Meanwhile the economic impacts of climate policy find their source through investments for the diffusion of environmental innovations, in parts a financial problem. Here, we expose how results of economic analysis of climate change mitigation policy depend entirely on assumptions and theory concerning the finance of the diffusion of innovations, and that in many cases, results are simply re-iterations of model assumptions. We show that, while equilibrium economics always predict economic slowdown, methods using non-equilibrium approaches suggest the opposite could occur. We show that the solution to understanding the economic impacts of reducing greenhouse gas emissions lies with research on the dynamics of the financial sector interacting with innovation and technology developments, economic history providing powerful insights through important analogies with previous historical waves of innovation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

Economics,A Simple Measure of Economic Complexity,"The conventional view on economic development simplifies a country's production to one aggregate variable, GDP. Yet product diversification matters for economic development, as recent, data-driven, ""economic complexity"" research suggests. A country's product diversity reflects the country's diversity of productive knowhow, or ""capabilities"". Researchers derive from algorithms (inspired by network theory) metrics that measure the number of capabilities in an economy, notably the Economic Complexity Index (ECI), argued to predict economic growth better than traditional variables such as human capital, and the country Fitness index. This paper offers an alternative economic complexity measure (founded on information theory) that derives from a simple model of production as a combinatorial process whereby a set of capabilities combine with some probability to transform raw materials into a product. A country's number of capabilities is given by the logarithm of its product diversity, as predicts the model, which also predicts a linear dependence between log-diversity, ECI, and log-fitness. The model's predictions fit the empirical data well; its informational interpretation, we argue, is a natural theoretical framework for the complex view on economic development.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,Quantifying China's Regional Economic Complexity,"China has experienced an outstanding economic expansion during the past decades, however, literature on non-monetary metrics that reveal the status of China's regional economic development are still lacking. In this paper, we fill this gap by quantifying the economic complexity of China's provinces through analyzing 25 years' firm data. First, we estimate the regional economic complexity index (ECI), and show that the overall time evolution of provinces' ECI is relatively stable and slow. Then, after linking ECI to the economic development and the income inequality, we find that the explanatory power of ECI is positive for the former but negative for the latter. Next, we compare different measures of economic diversity and explore their relationships with monetary macroeconomic indicators. Results show that the ECI index and the non-linear iteration based Fitness index are comparative, and they both have stronger explanatory power than other benchmark measures. Further multivariate regressions suggest the robustness of our results after controlling other socioeconomic factors. Our work moves forward a step towards better understanding China's regional economic development and non-monetary macroeconomic indicators.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

Then, with the common knowledge assumption, the paper studies a Ramsey growth model with endogenous structural transformation in which the social planner chooses the optimal industrial structure, recource allocation with the chosen structure, and consumption to maximize the representative household's total utility subject to the resource constraint. The paper next establishes the mathematical underpinning of the static, dynamic, and structural equilibria. The Ramsey growth model and its equilibria are then extended to economies with complicated economic structures consisting of hierarchical production, composite consumption, technology adoption and innovation, infrastructure, and economic and political institutions. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of applications of the proposed methodology to economic development problems in other scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

Economics,The Use of Quantile Methods in Economic History,"Quantile regression and quantile treatment effect methods are powerful econometric tools for considering economic impacts of events or variables of interest beyond the mean. The use of quantile methods allows for an examination of impacts of some independent variable over the entire distribution of continuous dependent variables. Measurement in many quantative settings in economic history have as a key input continuous outcome variables of interest. Among many other cases, human height and demographics, economic growth, earnings and wages, and crop production are generally recorded as continuous measures, and are collected and studied by economic historians. In this paper we describe and discuss the broad utility of quantile regression for use in research in economic history, review recent quantitive literature in the field, and provide an illustrative example of the use of these methods based on 20,000 records of human height measured across 50-plus years in the 19th and 20th centuries. We suggest that there is considerably more room in the literature on economic history to convincingly and productively apply quantile regression methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,Economic activity and climate change,"In this paper, we survey recent econometric contributions to measure the relationship between economic activity and climate change. Due to the critical relevance of these effects for the well-being of future generations, there is an explosion of publications devoted to measuring this relationship and its main channels. The relation between economic activity and climate change is complex with the possibility of causality running in both directions. Starting from economic activity, the channels that relate economic activity and climate change are energy consumption and the consequent pollution. Hence, we first describe the main econometric contributions about the interactions between economic activity and energy consumption, moving then to describing the contributions on the interactions between economic activity and pollution. Finally, we look at the main results on the relationship between climate change and economic activity. An important consequence of climate change is the increasing occurrence of extreme weather phenomena. Therefore, we also survey contributions on the economic effects of catastrophic climate phenomena.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,"Economic inequality and Islamic Charity: An exploratory agent-based
  modeling approach","Economic inequality is one of the pivotal issues for most of economic and social policy makers across the world to insure the sustainable economic growth and justice. In the mainstream school of economics, namely neoclassical theories, economic issues are dealt with in a mechanistic manner. Such a mainstream framework is majorly focused on investigating a socio-economic system based on an axiomatic scheme where reductionism approach plays a vital role. The major limitations of such theories include unbounded rationality of economic agents, reducing the economic aggregates to a set of predictable factors and lack of attention to adaptability and the evolutionary nature of economic agents. In tackling deficiencies of conventional economic models, in the past two decades, some new approaches have been recruited. One of those novel approaches is the Complex adaptive systems (CAS) framework which has shown a very promising performance in action. In contrast to mainstream school, under this framework, the economic phenomena are studied in an organic manner where the economic agents are supposed to be both boundedly rational and adaptive. According to it, the economic aggregates emerge out of the ways agents of a system decide and interact. As a powerful way of modeling CASs, Agent-based models (ABMs) has found a growing application among academicians and practitioners. ABMs show that how simple behavioral rules of agents and local interactions among them at micro-scale can generate surprisingly complex patterns at macro-scale. In this paper, ABMs have been used to show (1) how an economic inequality emerges in a system and to explain (2) how sadaqah as an Islamic charity rule can majorly help alleviating the inequality and how resource allocation strategies taken by charity entities can accelerate this alleviation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,Staring at Economic Aggregators through Information Lenses,"It is hard to exaggerate the role of economic aggregators -- functions that summarize numerous and / or heterogeneous data -- in economic models since the early XX$^{th}$ century. In many cases, as witnessed by the pioneering works of Cobb and Douglas, these functions were information quantities tailored to economic theories, i.e. they were built to fit economic phenomena. In this paper, we look at these functions from the complementary side: information. We use a recent toolbox built on top of a vast class of distortions coined by Bregman, whose application field rivals metrics' in various subfields of mathematics. This toolbox makes it possible to find the quality of an aggregator (for consumptions, prices, labor, capital, wages, etc.), from the standpoint of the information it carries. We prove a rather striking result.   From the informational standpoint, well-known economic aggregators do belong to the \textit{optimal} set. As common economic assumptions enter the analysis, this large set shrinks, and it essentially ends up \textit{exactly fitting} either CES, or Cobb-Douglas, or both. To summarize, in the relevant economic contexts, one could not have crafted better some aggregator from the information standpoint. We also discuss global economic behaviors of optimal information aggregators in general, and present a brief panorama of the links between economic and information aggregators.   Keywords: Economic Aggregators, CES, Cobb-Douglas, Bregman divergences",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,"Does Infrastructure Investment Lead to Economic Growth or Economic
  Fragility? Evidence from China","The prevalent view in the economics literature is that a high level of infrastructure investment is a precursor to economic growth. China is especially held up as a model to emulate. Based on the largest dataset of its kind, this paper punctures the twin myths that, first, infrastructure creates economic value, and, second, China has a distinct advantage in its delivery. Far from being an engine of economic growth, the typical infrastructure investment fails to deliver a positive risk adjusted return. Moreover, China's track record in delivering infrastructure is no better than that of rich democracies. Where investments are debt-financed, overinvesting in unproductive projects results in the buildup of debt, monetary expansion, instability in financial markets, and economic fragility, exactly as we see in China today. We conclude that poorly managed infrastructure investments are a main explanation of surfacing economic and financial problems in China. We predict that, unless China shifts to a lower level of higher-quality infrastructure investments, the country is headed for an infrastructure-led national financial and economic crisis, which is likely also to be a crisis for the international economy. China's infrastructure investment model is not one to follow for other countries but one to avoid.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,"Deep Neural Networks for Choice Analysis: Extracting Complete Economic
  Information for Interpretation","While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been increasingly applied to choice analysis showing high predictive power, it is unclear to what extent researchers can interpret economic information from DNNs. This paper demonstrates that DNNs can provide economic information as complete as classical discrete choice models (DCMs). The economic information includes choice predictions, choice probabilities, market shares, substitution patterns of alternatives, social welfare, probability derivatives, elasticities, marginal rates of substitution (MRS), and heterogeneous values of time (VOT). Unlike DCMs, DNNs can automatically learn the utility function and reveal behavioral patterns that are not prespecified by domain experts. However, the economic information obtained from DNNs can be unreliable because of the three challenges associated with the automatic learning capacity: high sensitivity to hyperparameters, model non-identification, and local irregularity. To demonstrate the strength and challenges of DNNs, we estimated the DNNs using a stated preference survey, extracted the full list of economic information from the DNNs, and compared them with those from the DCMs. We found that the economic information either aggregated over trainings or population is more reliable than the disaggregate information of the individual observations or trainings, and that even simple hyperparameter searching can significantly improve the reliability of the economic information extracted from the DNNs. Future studies should investigate other regularizations and DNN architectures, better optimization algorithms, and robust DNN training methods to address DNNs' three challenges, to provide more reliable economic information from DNN-based choice models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,"The AI Economist: Optimal Economic Policy Design via Two-level Deep
  Reinforcement Learning","AI and reinforcement learning (RL) have improved many areas, but are not yet widely adopted in economic policy design, mechanism design, or economics at large. At the same time, current economic methodology is limited by a lack of counterfactual data, simplistic behavioral models, and limited opportunities to experiment with policies and evaluate behavioral responses. Here we show that machine-learning-based economic simulation is a powerful policy and mechanism design framework to overcome these limitations. The AI Economist is a two-level, deep RL framework that trains both agents and a social planner who co-adapt, providing a tractable solution to the highly unstable and novel two-level RL challenge. From a simple specification of an economy, we learn rational agent behaviors that adapt to learned planner policies and vice versa. We demonstrate the efficacy of the AI Economist on the problem of optimal taxation. In simple one-step economies, the AI Economist recovers the optimal tax policy of economic theory. In complex, dynamic economies, the AI Economist substantially improves both utilitarian social welfare and the trade-off between equality and productivity over baselines. It does so despite emergent tax-gaming strategies, while accounting for agent interactions and behavioral change more accurately than economic theory. These results demonstrate for the first time that two-level, deep RL can be used for understanding and as a complement to theory for economic design, unlocking a new computational learning-based approach to understanding economic policy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,"A 3D index for measuring economic resilience with application to the
  modern international and global financial crises","The study and measurement of economic resilience is ruled by high level of complexity related to the diverse structure, functionality, spatiality, and dynamics describing economic systems. Towards serving the demand of integration, this paper develops a three-dimensional index, capturing engineering, ecological, and evolutionary aspects of economic resilience that are considered separately in the current literature. The proposed index is computed on GDP data of worldwide countries, for the period 1960-2020, concerning 14 crises considered as shocks, and was found well defined in a conceptual context of its components. Its application on real-world data allows introducing a novel classification of countries in terms of economic resilience, and reveals geographical patterns and structural determinants of this attribute. Impressively enough, economic resilience appears positively related to major productivity coefficients, gravitationally driven, and depended on agricultural specialization, with high structural heterogeneity in the low class. Also, the analysis fills the literature gap by shaping the worldwide map of economic resilience, revealing geographical duality and centrifugal patterns in its geographical distribution, a relationship between diachronically good performance in economic resilience and geographical distance from the shocks origin, and a continent differentiation expressed by the specialization of America in engineering resilience, Africa and Asia in ecological and evolutionary resilience, and a relative lag of Europe and Oceania. Finally, the analysis provides insights into the effect of the 2008 on the globe and supports a further research hypothesis that political instability is a main determinant of low economic resilience, addressing avenues of further research.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

It has been shown that the vector space of economic states constructed on the basis of these measurements is relativistic. The laws of kinematics of economic objects in this space have been analyzed and the stages of constructing the dynamics have been formulated. In particular, the principle of maximum benefit, which represents an economic analog of the principle of least action in the classical mechanics, and the principle of relativity as the principle of equality of all possible consumer preferences have been formulated. The notion of economic interval between two economic objects invariant to the selection of the vector of consumer preferences has been introduced.

However, computing these indices based on traditional economic census is usually costly and resources consuming, and more importantly, following a long time delay. In this paper, we analyzed nearly 200 million users' activities for four consecutive years in the largest social network (Sina Microblog) in China, aiming at exploring latent relationships between the online social activities and local economic status. Results indicate that online social activity has a strong correlation with local economic development and industrial structure, and more interestingly, allows revealing the macro-economic structure instantaneously with nearly no cost. Beyond, this work also provides a new venue to identify risky signal in local economic structure.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,Unified Growth Theory Contradicted by the Economic Growth in Asia,"Historical economic growth in Asia (excluding Japan) is analysed. It is shown that Unified Growth Theory is contradicted by the data, which were used (but not analysed) during the formulation of this theory. Unified Growth Theory does not explain the mechanism of economic growth. It explains the mechanism of Malthusian stagnation, which did not exist and it explains the mechanism of the transition from stagnation to growth that did not happen. The data show that the economic growth in Asia was never stagnant but hyperbolic. The alleged dramatic takeoff around 1900 or around any other time did not happen. However, the theory contains also a dangerous and strongly-misleading concept that after a long epoch of stagnation we have now entered the epoch of sustained economic growth, the concept creating the sense of security. The opposite is true. After the epoch of sustained and secure economic growth we have now entered the epoch of a fast-increasing and insecure economic growth.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

Although this survey provides insights regarding economic policy for policymakers, a clear definition of the word ""future"" in future economic conditions is not provided. Hence, the assessments respondents provide in the survey are simply based on their interpretations of the meaning of ""future."" This motivated us to reveal the different interpretations of the future in their judgments of future economic conditions by applying weakly supervised learning and text mining. In our research, we separate the assessments of future economic conditions into economic conditions of the near and distant future using learning from positive and unlabeled data (PU learning). Because the dataset includes data from several periods, we devised new architecture to enable neural networks to conduct PU learning based on the idea of multi-task learning to efficiently learn a classifier.

This paper presents related concepts in the equilibrium economic model and constructs significant theorems and corollaries, which is derived from the priori possibility postulate, getting theorems including the equilibrium theorem between open systems, the distribution theorem of wealth and population along with related corollaries. More importantly, we demonstrate a method constructing optimal density of states, optimizing a macroscopic parameter depending on need to get the distribution of density of states utilizing the variation method, which is significant for the development of a society.

Economics,"The Interdependence of Hierarchical Institutions: Federal Regulation,

We focus on regional variation in the effects of national-level regulations by developing a theory of hierarchical institutional interdependence. Using the political science theory of market-preserving federalism, we argue that regional economic freedom attenuates the negative influence of national regulation on net job creation. Using U.S. data, we find that regulation destroys jobs on net, but regional economic freedom moderates this effect. In regions with average economic freedom, a one percent increase in regulation results in 14 fewer jobs created on net. However, a standard deviation increase in economic freedom attenuates this relationship by four fewer jobs. Interestingly, this moderation accrues strictly to older firms; regulation usually harms young firm job creation, and economic freedom does not attenuate this relationship.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

The amount of carbon emission caused by production activities is closely related to the socio-economic environment. Therefore, from the perspective of economic policy uncertainty, this article constructs the GARCH-MIDAS-EUEPU and GARCH-MIDAS-GEPU models for investigating the impact of European and global economic policy uncertainty on carbon price fluctuations. The results show that both European and global economic policy uncertainty will exacerbate the long-term volatility of European carbon spot return, with the latter having a stronger impact when the change is the same. Moreover, the volatility of the European carbon spot return can be forecasted better by the predictor, global economic policy uncertainty. This research can provide some implications for market managers in grasping carbon market trends and helping participants control the risk of fluctuations in carbon allowances.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

  Linkage","This paper aims to estimate the impact of economic and financial crises on the unemployment rate in the European Union, taking also into consideration the institutional specificities, since unemployment was the main channel through which the economic and financial crisis influenced the social developments.. In this context, I performed two institutional clusters depending on their inclusive or extractive institutional features and, in each cases, I computed the crisis effect on unemployment rate over the 2003-2017 period. Both models were estimated by using Panel Estimated Generalized Least Squares method, and are weighted by Period SUR option in order to remove, in advance the possible inconveniences of the models. The institutions proved to be a relevant criterion that drives the impact of economic and financial crises on the unemployment rate, highlighting that countries with inclusive institutions are less vulnerable to economic shocks and are more resilient than countries with extractive institutions. The quality of institutions was also found to have a significant effect on the response of unemployment rate to the dynamic of its drivers.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1
Economics,"Do economic effects of the anti-COVID-19 lockdowns in different regions
  interact through supply chains?","To prevent the spread of COVID-19, many cities, states, and countries have `locked down', restricting economic activities in non-essential sectors. Such lockdowns have substantially shrunk production in most countries. This study examines how the economic effects of lockdowns in different regions interact through supply chains, a network of firms for production, simulating an agent-based model of production on supply-chain data for 1.6 million firms in Japan. We further investigate how the complex network structure affects the interactions of lockdowns, emphasising the role of upstreamness and loops by decomposing supply-chain flows into potential and circular flow components. We find that a region's upstreamness, intensity of loops, and supplier substitutability in supply chains with other regions largely determine the economic effect of the lockdown in the region. In particular, when a region lifts its lockdown, its economic recovery substantially varies depending on whether it lifts lockdown alone or together with another region closely linked through supply chains. These results propose the need for inter-region policy coordination to reduce the economic loss from lockdowns.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

The mutual relationship between the urbanization of any country and its economic productive structure is far from being understood. We analyzed the historical evolution of product exports for all countries using the World Trade Web (WTW) with respect to patterns of urbanization from 1995-2010. Using the evolving framework of economic complexity, we reveal that a country's economic development in terms of its production and export of goods, is interwoven with the urbanization process during the early stages of its economic development and growth. Meanwhile in urbanized countries, the reciprocal relation between economic growth and urbanization fades away with respect to its later stages, becoming negligible for countries highly dependent on the export of resources where urbanization is not linked to any structural economic transformation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

  pandemic -- Evidence from an online experiment","This paper studies whether and how differently projected information about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic affects individuals' prosocial behavior and expectations on future outcomes. We conducted an online experiment with British participants (N=961) when the UK introduced its first lockdown and the outbreak was on its growing stage. Participants were primed with either the environmental or economic consequences (i.e., negative primes), or the environmental or economic benefits (i.e., positive primes) of the pandemic, or with neutral information. We measured priming effects on an incentivized take-and-give dictator game and on participants' expectations about future environmental quality and economic growth. Our results show that primes affect participants' expectations, but not their prosociality. In particular, participants primed with environmental consequences hold a more pessimistic view on future environmental quality, while those primed with economic benefits are more optimistic about future economic growth. Instead, the positive environmental prime and the negative economic prime do not influence expectations. Our results offer insights into how information affects behavior and expectations during the Covid-19 pandemic.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

  Auto-Embedding","It has been found that human mobility exhibits random patterns following the Levy flight, where human movement contains many short flights and some long flights, and these flights follow a power-law distribution. In this paper, we study the social-economical development trajectories of urban cities. We observe that social-economical movement of cities also exhibit the Levy flight characteristics. We collect the social and economical data such as the population, the number of students, GDP and personal income, etc. from several cities. Then we map these urban data into the social and economical factors through a deep-learning embedding method Auto-Encoder. We find that the social-economical factors of these cities can be fitted approximately as a movement pattern of a power-law distribution. We use the Stochastic Multiplicative Processes (SMP) to explain such movement, where in the presence of a boundary constraint, the SMP leads to a power law distribution. It means that the social-economical trajectories of cities also follow a Levy flight pattern, where some years have large changes in terms of social-economical development, and many years have little changes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

Economics,An Interacting Agent Model of Economic Crisis,"Most national economies are linked by international trade. Consequently, economic globalization forms a massive and complex economic network with strong links, that is, interactions arising from increasing trade. Various interesting collective motions are expected to emerge from strong economic interactions in a global economy under trade liberalization. Among the various economic collective motions, economic crises are our most intriguing problem. In our previous studies, we have revealed that the Kuramoto's coupled limit-cycle oscillator model and the Ising-like spin model on networks are invaluable tools for characterizing the economic crises. In this study, we develop a mathematical theory to describe an interacting agent model that derives the Kuramoto model and the Ising-like spin model by using appropriate approximations. Our interacting agent model suggests phase synchronization and spin ordering during economic crises. We confirm the emergence of the phase synchronization and spin ordering during economic crises by analyzing various economic time series data. We also develop a network reconstruction model based on entropy maximization that considers the sparsity of the network. Here network reconstruction means estimating a network's adjacency matrix from a node's local information. The interbank network is reconstructed using the developed model, and a comparison is made of the reconstructed network with the actual data. We successfully reproduce the interbank network and the known stylized facts. In addition, the exogenous shock acting on an industry community in a supply chain network and financial sector are estimated. Estimation of exogenous shocks acting on communities of in the real economy in the supply chain network provide evidence of the channels of distress propagating from the financial sector to the real economy through the supply chain network.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

  copulas and news wires","We study association between macroeconomic news and stock market returns using the statistical theory of copulas, and a new comprehensive measure of news based on the indexing of news wires. We find the impact of economic news on equity returns to be nonlinear and asymmetric. In particular, controlling for economic conditions and surprises associated with releases of economic data, we find that the market reacts strongly and negatively to the most unfavourable macroeconomic news, but appears to largely discount the good news. This relationship persists throughout the different stages of the business cycle.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

Economics,IMF Lending and Economic Growth: An Empirical Analysis of Ukraine,"This study uses Vector Autoregression (VAR) Methodology as well as Vector Error Correction (VEC) Methodology to examine the existence and direction of causality between economic growth and IMF lending for Ukraine. The paper examines the IMF lending data for the period of 1991-2010. Robust empirical analysis indicates that IMF lending has a negative effect of on Ukraine's economic growth in the short term. Policy implications of this finding are that, despite short-run decline in economic growth, IMF lending can result in a long-run sustainable growth for Ukraine. For this, policymakers need to ensure that fund's money are used not only to cover budget's deficit, but also to finance institutional reforms.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09125v1

This is consistent with the empirical pattern known as 'the hump'. Our results question the common association of variety with complexity.

  matrices","Testing large covariance matrices is of fundamental importance in statistical analysis with high-dimensional data. In the past decade, three types of test statistics have been studied in the literature: quadratic form statistics, maximum form statistics, and their weighted combination. It is known that quadratic form statistics would suffer from low power against sparse alternatives and maximum form statistics would suffer from low power against dense alternatives. The weighted combination methods were introduced to enhance the power of quadratic form statistics or maximum form statistics when the weights are appropriately chosen. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to exploit the full potential of quadratic form statistics and maximum form statistics for testing high-dimensional covariance matrices. We propose a scale-invariant power enhancement test based on Fisher's method to combine the p-values of quadratic form statistics and maximum form statistics. After carefully studying the asymptotic joint distribution of quadratic form statistics and maximum form statistics, we prove that the proposed combination method retains the correct asymptotic size and boosts the power against more general alternatives. Moreover, we demonstrate the finite-sample performance in simulation studies and a real application.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1

Statistics,Higher criticism: $p$-values and criticism,"This paper compares the higher criticism statistic (Donoho and Jin [Ann. Statist. 32 (2004) 962-994]), a modification of the higher criticism statistic also suggested by Donoho and Jin, and two statistics of the Berk-Jones [Z. Wahrsch. Verw. Gebiete 47 (1979) 47-59] type. New approximations to the significance levels of the statistics are derived, and their accuracy is studied by simulations. By numerical examples it is shown that over a broad range of sample sizes the Berk-Jones statistics have a better power function than the higher criticism statistics to detect sparse mixtures. The applications suggested by Meinshausen and Rice [Ann. Statist. 34 (2006) 373-393], to find lower confidence bounds for the number of false hypotheses, and by Jeng, Cai and Li [Biometrika 100 (2013) 157-172], to detect copy number variants, are also studied.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,"Study of invariance of nonextensive statistics under the uniform energy
  spectrum translation","The general formalisms of the $q$-dual statistics, the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, and three versions of the Tsallis statistics known as Tsallis-1, Tsallis-2, and Tsallis-3 statistics have been considered in the canonical ensemble. We have rigorously proved that the probability distribution of the Tsallis-1 statistics is invariant under the uniform energy spectrum translation at a fixed temperature. This invariance demonstrates that the formalism of the Tsallis-1 statistics is consistent with the fundamentals of the equilibrium statistical mechanics. The same results we have obtained for the probability distributions of the Tsallis-3 statistics, Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, and $q$-dual statistics. However, we have found that the probability distribution of the Tsallis-2 statistics, the expectation values of which are not consistent with the normalization condition of probabilities, is indeed not invariant under the overall shift in energy as expected.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,"Statistical properties and statistical interaction for particles with
  spin: Hubbard model in one dimension and statistical spin liquid","We derive the statistical distribution functions for the Hubbard chain with infinite Coulomb repulsion among particles and for the statistical spin liquid with an arbitrary magnitude of the local interaction in momentum space. Haldane's statistical interaction is derived from an exact solution for each of the two models. In the case of the Hubbard chain the charge (holon) and the spin (spinon) excitations decouple completely and are shown to behave statistically as fermions and bosons, respectively. In both cases the statistical interaction must contain several components, a rule for the particles with the internal symmetry.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,"Normal approximation for nonlinear statistics using a concentration
  inequality approach","Let $T$ be a general sampling statistic that can be written as a linear statistic plus an error term. Uniform and non-uniform Berry--Esseen type bounds for $T$ are obtained. The bounds are the best possible for many known statistics. Applications to U-statistics, multisample U-statistics, L-statistics, random sums and functions of nonlinear statistics are discussed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,"The emergence of French statistics. How mathematics entered the world of
  statistics in France during the 1920s","This paper concerns the emergence of modern mathematical statistics in France after the First World War. Emile Borel's achievements are presented, and especially his creation of two institutions where mathematical statistics was developed: the {\it Statistical Institute of Paris University}, (ISUP) in 1922 and above all the {\it Henri Poincar\'e Institute} (IHP) in 1928. At the IHP, a new journal {\it Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincar\'e} was created in 1931. We discuss the first papers in that journal dealing with mathematical statistics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,"Stochastic simulations for the time evolution of systems which obey
  generalized statistics: Fractional exclusion statistics and Gentile's
  statistics","We present a stochastic method for the simulation of the time evolution in systems which obey generalized statistics, namely fractional exclusion statistics and Gentile's statistics. The transition rates are derived in the framework of canonical ensembles. This approach introduces a tool for describing interacting fermionic and bosonic systems in non-equilibrium as ideal FES systems, in a computationally efficient manner. The two types of statistics are analyzed comparatively, indicating their intrinsic thermodynamic differences and revealing key aspects related to the species size.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,Nonequilibrium statistical operator method in the Renyi statistics,The generalization of the Zubarev nonequilibrium statistical operator method for the case of Renyi statistics is proposed when the relevant statistical operator (or distribution function) is obtained based on the principle of maximum for the Renyi entropy. The nonequilibrium statistical operator and corresponding generalized transport equations for the reduced-description parameters are obtained. A consistent description of kinetic and hydrodynamic processes in the system of interacting particles is considered as an example.,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,"Distribution of a Non-parametric Wavelet-based Statistic for Functional
  Data","Mathematical formulations and proofs for a wavelet based statistic employed in functional data analysis is elaborately discussed in this report. The propositions and derivations discussed here apply to a wavelet based statistic with hard thresholding. The proposed analytic distribution is made feasible only due to the assumption of normality. Since the statistic is developed for applications in high dimensional data analysis, the assumption holds true in most practical situations. In the future, the work here could be extended to address data that are non-Gaussian. Aside from establishing a rigorous mathematical foundation for the distribution of the statistic, the report also explores a few approximations for the proposed statistic.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,Immersions into Statistical Manifolds,This paper studies the geometry of immersions into statistical manifolds. A necessary and sufficient condition is obtained for statistical manifold structures to be dual to each other for a non-degenerate equiaffine immersion. Then we obtain conditions for realizing an n-dimensional statistical manifold in an (n+1)-dimensional statistical manifold and its converse. Centro-affine immersion of codimension two into a dually flat statistical manifold is defined. Also we have shown that statistical manifold realized in a dually flat statistical manifold of codimension two is conformally-projectively flat.,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,On Model Selection with Summary Statistics,"Recently, many authors have cast doubts on the validity of ABC model choice. It has been shown that the use of sufficient statistic in ABC model selection leads, apart from few exceptional cases in which the sufficient statistic is also cross-model sufficient, to unreliable results. In a single model context and given a sufficient summary statistic, we show that it is possible to fully recover the posterior normalising constant, without using the likelihood function. The idea can be applied, in an approximate way, to more realistic scenarios in which the sufficient statistic is not unavailable but a ""good"" summary statistic for estimation is available.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,"Robust test statistics for the two-way MANOVA based on the minimum
  covariance determinant estimator","Robust test statistics for the two-way MANOVA based on the minimum covariance determinant (MCD) estimator are proposed as alternatives to the classical Wilks' Lambda test statistics which are well known to be very sensitive to outliers as they are based on classical normal theory estimates of generalized variances. The classical Wilks' Lambda statistics are robustified by replacing the classical estimates by highly robust and efficient reweighted MCD estimates. Further, Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the new test statistics under various designs by investigating their finite sample accuracy, power, and robustness against outliers. Finally, these robust test statistics are applied to a real data example.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,The standard map: From Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics to Tsallis statistics,"As well known, Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics is the correct way of thermostatistically approaching ergodic systems. On the other hand, nontrivial ergodicity breakdown and strong correlations typically drag the system into out-of-equilibrium states where Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics fails. For a wide class of such systems, it has been shown in recent years that the correct approach is to use Tsallis statistics instead. Here we show how the dynamics of the paradigmatic conservative (area-preserving) standard map exhibits, in an exceptionally clear manner, the crossing from one statistics to the other. Our results unambiguously illustrate the domains of validity of both Boltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis statistics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,Statistical reform and the replication crisis,"The replication crisis has prompted many to call for statistical reform within the psychological sciences. Here we examine issues within Frequentist statistics that may have led to the replication crisis, and we examine the alternative---Bayesian statistics---that many have suggested as a replacement. The Frequentist approach and the Bayesian approach offer radically different perspectives on evidence and inference with the Frequentist approach prioritising error control and the Bayesian approach offering a formal method for quantifying the relative strength of evidence for hypotheses. We suggest that rather than mere statistical reform, what is needed is a better understanding of the different modes of statistical inference and a better understanding of how statistical inference relates to scientific inference.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,Statistical Epistemic Logic,"We introduce a modal logic for describing statistical knowledge, which we call statistical epistemic logic. We propose a Kripke model dealing with probability distributions and stochastic assignments, and show a stochastic semantics for the logic. To our knowledge, this is the first semantics for modal logic that can express the statistical knowledge dependent on non-deterministic inputs and the statistical significance of observed results. By using statistical epistemic logic, we express a notion of statistical secrecy with a confidence level. We also show that this logic is useful to formalize statistical hypothesis testing and differential privacy in a simple and abstract manner.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,"Intermediate symmetric construction of transformation between anyon and
  Gentile statistics","Gentile statistics describes fractional statistical systems in the occupation number representation. Anyon statistics researches those systems in the winding number representation. Both of them are intermediate statistics between Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics. The second quantization of Gentile statistics shows a lot of advantages. According to the symmetry requirement of the wave function, we give the general construction of transformation between anyon and Gentile statistics. In other words, we introduce the second quantization form of anyons in a easy way. Basic relations of second quantization operators, the coherent state and Berry phase are also discussed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,A Goodness-of-Fit Test for Statistical Models,"Statistical modeling plays a fundamental role in understanding the underlying mechanism of massive data (statistical inference) and predicting the future (statistical prediction). Although all models are wrong, researchers try their best to make some of them be useful. The question here is how can we measure the usefulness of a statistical model for the data in hand? This is key to statistical prediction. The important statistical problem of testing whether the observations follow the proposed statistical model has only attracted relatively few attentions. In this paper, we proposed a new framework for this problem through building its connection with two-sample distribution comparison. The proposed method can be applied to evaluate a wide range of models. Examples are given to show the performance of the proposed method.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,On Some Mathematics Related to the Interpolating Statistics,"Motivated by fractional quantum Hall effects, we introduce a universal space of statistics interpolating Bose-Einstein statistics and Fermi-Dirac statistics. We connect the interpolating statistics to umbral calculus and use it as a bridge to study the interpolation statistics by the principle maximum entropy by deformed entropy functions. On the one hand this connection makes it possible to relate fractional quantum Hall effects to many different mathematical objects, including formal group laws, complex bordism theory, complex genera, operads, counting trees, spectral curves in Eynard-Orantin topological recursions, etc. On the other hand, this also suggests to reexamine umbral calculus from the point of view of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,Direct statistical simulation of the Lorenz63 system,"We use direct statistical simulation (DSS) to find the low-order statistics of the well-known dynamical system, the Lorenz63 model. Instead of accumulating statistics from numerical simulation of the dynamical systems, we solve the equations of motion for the statistics themselves after closing them by making several different choices for the truncation. Fixed points of the statistics are obtained either by time evolving, or by iterative methods. Statistics so obtained are compared to those found by the traditional approach.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,Six Statistical Senses,"This article proposes a set of categories, each one representing a particular distillation of important statistical ideas. Each category is labeled a ""sense"" because we think of these as essential in helping every statistical mind connect in constructive and insightful ways with statistical theory, methodologies, and computation, toward the ultimate goal of building statistical phronesis. The illustration of each sense with statistical principles and methods provides a sensical tour of the conceptual landscape of statistics, as a leading discipline in the data science ecosystem.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,Statistical $p$-convergence in lattice-normed Riesz spaces,"A sequence $(x_n)$ in a lattice-normed space $(X,p,E)$ is statistical $p$-convergent to $x\in X$ if there exists a statistical $p$-decreasing sequence $q\stpd 0$ with an index set $K$ such that $\delta(K)=1$ and $p(x_{n_k}-x)\leq q_{n_k}$ for every $n_k\in K$. This convergence has been investigated recently for $(X,p,E)=(E,|\cdot|,E)$ under the name of statistical order convergence and under the name of statistical multiplicative order convergence, and also, for taking $E$ as a locally solid Riesz space under the names statistically unbounded $\tau$-convergence and statistically multiplicative convergence. In this paper, we study the general properties of statistical $p$-convergence.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
Statistics,Statistical discrimination and statistical informativeness,"We study the link between Phelps-Aigner-Cain-type statistical discrimination and familiar notions of statistical informativeness. Our central insight is that Blackwell's Theorem, suitably relabeled, characterizes statistical discrimination in terms of statistical informativeness. This delivers one-half of Chambers and Echenique's (2021) characterization of statistical discrimination as a corollary, and suggests a different interpretation of it: that discrimination is inevitable. In addition, Blackwell's Theorem delivers a number of finer-grained insights into the nature of statistical discrimination. We argue that the discrimination-informativeness link is quite general, illustrating with an informativeness characterization of a different type of discrimination.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1

Statistics,Goodness-of-fit tests via phi-divergences,"A unified family of goodness-of-fit tests based on $\phi$-divergences is introduced and studied. The new family of test statistics $S_n(s)$ includes both the supremum version of the Anderson--Darling statistic and the test statistic of Berk and Jones [Z. Wahrsch. Verw. Gebiete 47 (1979) 47--59] as special cases ($s=2$ and $s=1$, resp.). We also introduce integral versions of the new statistics. We show that the asymptotic null distribution theory of Berk and Jones [Z. Wahrsch. Verw. Gebiete 47 (1979) 47--59] and Wellner and Koltchinskii [High Dimensional Probability III (2003) 321--332. Birkh\""{a}user, Basel] for the Berk--Jones statistic applies to the whole family of statistics $S_n(s)$ with $s\in[-1,2]$. On the side of power behavior, we study the test statistics under fixed alternatives and give extensions of the ``Poisson boundary'' phenomena noted by Berk and Jones for their statistic. We also extend the results of Donoho and Jin [Ann. Statist. 32 (2004) 962--994] by showing that all our new tests for $s\in[-1,2]$ have the same ``optimal detection boundary'' for normal shift mixture alternatives as Tukey's ``higher-criticism'' statistic and the Berk--Jones statistic.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611224v1
